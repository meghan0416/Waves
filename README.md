These two waves were made as part of a for-fun project during my study abroad. They are coded in Processing, which is very similar to Java.

The 2D Wave produces this:

![A blue-green sequence of elliptical shapes growing a shrinking to create an illusion of a wave.](https://github.com/meghan0416/Waves/blob/master/wave/MeghanGrayson_wave.gif?raw=true)

The 3D Wave produces this:

![An isometric view of voxels in a wave motion.](https://github.com/meghan0416/Waves/blob/master/fast_3D.gif?raw=true)
